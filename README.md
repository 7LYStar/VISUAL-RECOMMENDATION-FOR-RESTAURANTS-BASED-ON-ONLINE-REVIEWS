VISUAL RECOMMENDATION FOR RESTAURANTS  BASED ON ONLINE REVIEWS
## Introduction
 In recent years internet technology has developed at a rapid pace,mobile phone softwares and online platforms have
 infiltrated every aspect of our lives. With more and more users active on the Internet, a huge number of users express
 their views and attitudes on online platforms every day, this led to the creation of User Generated Media (UGM)[1]. For
 instance, Twitter, Facebook, yelp etc. are all UMGs, which allow users to freely express their opinions and share their
 experiences, and this even makes it more convenient for people to solve problems in their daily lives. It has become a
 trend for people to use online platforms to express their views.</br>
 While diet is undoubtedly vital to people, in the age of the internet, the way people choose restaurants has changed. In
 the past, people often relied on the words of mouth recommendations from friends or family to choose a restaurant,
 but nowadays people can access more information about restaurants through online platforms. The product reviews
 posted by users in these online platforms are often called electronic word-of-mouth messages (e-WOM) [2]. In
 addition, compared with the traditional word-of-mouth mode of obtaining information, the amount of information on
 the Internet is larger and the views are more diverse.[3]. This prevents users from being influenced by a single extreme
 viewpoint.Like yelp, which provides a platform for users to evaluate restaurants, users can view restaurant ratings
 or read other peopleâ€™s reviews to understand the level of service. And people are increasingly relying on evaluating
 products and services based on this information, which helps them to make better decisions[4].</br>
 However, the ratings provided by platforms are sometimes not accurate .In this age of the data-rich internet, reading
 thousands of reviews to obtain an understanding of products and services can be very time-consuming[5]. After
 investigation, the current catering industry does lack a visual recommendation platform for sentiment analysis based on
 user reviews.</br>
 In this paper, we set out to build a visualization solution for applying sentiment analysis and topic extraction. Collect
 restaurant data and restaurant user review data from yelp platform, which will be used to train topic models for review
 topic extraction, train machine learning models for sentiment analysis. Then build a visualization platform. With the
 topic model, we will analyze the topic of each review and label it. With the machine learning model, we will analyze
 the sentiment of a review and derive its positive sentiment probability. And quantify the sentiment bias of the review
 through the positive sentiment probability. Compared to platform ratings, emotional features implicit in text are more
 effective in helping consumers make decisions[6]. Finally, we will build a clear and concise visualization platform to
 display basic information and sentiment scores of the restaurant, helping users to get useful information more easily
 and quickly.
